# VLSI (Very Large-Scale Integration) technology is widely used for designing and implementing logic gates. VLSI technology involves the integration of thousands to millions of transistors on a single chip, allowing for the creation of complex digital systems. In this report, some selected logic gates are designed using the  Electric software EDA tool and the LTSPICE simulator.

Project Objectives
The objectives of this project is design and simulate the operation of the following gates using the Electric and LTSPICE simulator
•	Design an inverter CMOS gate using the Electric layout and schematic tools
•	Design 2-input NAND gate using the Electric layout and schematic tools
•	Design NOR gate using the Electric layout and schematic tools
